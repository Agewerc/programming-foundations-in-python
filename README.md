# Programming Foundations In Python

This repository holds projects developed in the unit was a unit Programming Foundations in Python - FIT9133 from the Master of Data Science at Monash University 1/2019 which provided understanding of program design and implementation of algorithms to solve computational problems. Two of the projects developed are:

1. **Nerd Score Calculator**: Implementation of a functioning program that allows individuals to calculate their ‘nerd skill level’. Includes a menu that allow sthe program to be used, an equation which can be used to calculate the score, and a printout that allows a summation of the results.

2. **Building a Text Parser**: Object-oriented programming task involving XML text parsing without the use of libraries. The parser is able to perform basic data extraction, statistical analysis on a number of linguistic features and also to present the analysis results using some form of visualization.

Some of the knowledge exposed in this projects:
1. Object Oriented Programming
2. File Manipulation, Testing and Exception Handling
3. Data Structures, Collective Data Types and Control Structures
4. Concepts of Decomposition and Abstract Data Types
